/*08. Letâ€™s say you are working for an event management company. As a web developer, you need to build a 
countdown timer for an upcoming event. You need to build a function that calculates the number of days 
between the current date and the event's start date.*/

function calculateRemainingDays(eventDate) {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const eventDateTime = new Date(eventDate);

    const timeDifference = eventDateTime - currentDate;
    const daysRemaining = Math.ceil(timeDifference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

    return daysRemaining;
}

const eventDate = '2023-08-31'
console.log(calculateRemainingDays(eventDate));

// OUTPUT: 30
