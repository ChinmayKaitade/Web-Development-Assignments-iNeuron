        Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
        explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
        showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
        information about the typographers and their process, as well as
        analytics on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections
        helps you discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our
        team of designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort
        organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic
        location. You can also create your own highly customized collections by
        filtering families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and
        review sample copy. Collections can be shared, making it easy to
        collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and
        streamlined throughout the design and engineering process. In 2021, we
        added icons to our Google Fonts catalog, expanding expressive capability
        for our users. Our first set was the Material icons—delightful,
        beautifully crafted symbols for common communication needs. Download
        them on desktop to use them in your digital products for Android, iOS,
        and web.
