9. What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags.
ans:
Self-closing tag: A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag as </tag>. 
Some few self-closing tags are <input/>, <hr/>, <br/>, <img/>, etc.

Meta tags: Meta tags are HTML tags used to provide additional information about a page to search engines and other clients. 
They do not directly affect the visual appearance of a webpage, but rather provide information about the content of the page.
Meta tags are placed in the head section of an HTML document and can include various types of information, including the title of the page, a brief description of the content, keywords that describe the content of the page, the author of the page, the language of the page, and more.
