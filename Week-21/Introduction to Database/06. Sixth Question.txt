06. What is the significance of Data Modelling and explain the types of data modelling.
Ans :- Data modeling is vital in database design for several reasons :
- Clarity and Consistency: It ensures a clear understanding of data requirements among 
stakeholders, reducing ambiguity and ensuring consistency in data storage and access.

- Efficiency in Development: It streamlines the development process by providing a 
visual representation of the database structure, reducing errors, and facilitating 
collaboration.

- Improved Communication: Data models serve as a common language for discussing data 
requirements among stakeholders, validating their understanding of the system.

- Scalability and Flexibility: Well-designed data models anticipate future changes, 
allowing for the system to adapt to evolving business needs and technological 
advancements.

- Optimized Performance: By identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, data modeling 
helps optimize database performance, improving query execution times.


Types of Data Modeling:
- Conceptual Data Modeling: Focuses on high-level business concepts and relationships.

- Logical Data Modeling: Translates the conceptual model into a detailed representation
closer to the database implementation.

- Physical Data Modeling: Specifies how the logical data model will be implemented in a
specific DBMS, guiding database creation and optimization.

Each type serves a distinct purpose, from capturing business requirements to defining 
the detailed database implementation, ensuring robust and efficient systems.
