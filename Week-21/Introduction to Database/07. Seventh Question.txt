07. Explain 3 Schema architecture along with its advantages.
Ans :- The three-schema architecture, also known as ANSI/SPARC architecture, is a 
framework for organizing databases into three distinct layers:
- External Schema (View level):
▪ This schema represents the part of the database that a particular user or group of 
users is interested in.
▪ It defines various views of the database tailored to the specific needs of different 
users or applications.
▪ Users interact with the database through this schema, which hides the complexities of 
the underlying logical and physical structures.

- Conceptual Schema (Logical level):
▪ This schema presents the overall logical structure of the entire database as seen by 
the database administrator.
▪ It abstracts away details of how data is stored and focuses on defining the entities, 
their attributes, and the relationships between them.
▪ Changes to this schema should ideally be transparent to the external schema, ensuring 
data independence.

- Internal Schema (Physical level):
▪ This schema describes how data is stored physically on the storage devices, such as 
disks.
▪ It defines data structures, storage allocation, indexing methods, and other physical 
implementation details.
▪ Changes to the internal schema should ideally be transparent to both the conceptual 
and external schemas, ensuring physical data independence.


Advantages of the three-schema architecture include:
- Data Independence:
It allows for changes to be made at one schema level without affecting the other levels,
providing independence between different views of the data, logical structure, and physical storage.

- Enhanced Security and Privacy:
Different users or applications can have access to different external schemas, providing
a level of security and privacy by controlling what data each user can see and 
manipulate.

- Flexibility and Adaptability:
The architecture enables the modification of one schema without affecting the others, 
making it easier to adapt the database to evolving requirements and changes in 
technology.

- Improved Maintenance and Development:
Developers can work independently on different schema levels, which facilitates easier
maintenance and development of the database system.

- Data Abstraction:
It provides a clear separation between the conceptual view of the data and its physical
storage, allowing users and applications to interact with the data at a higher level of
abstraction.
