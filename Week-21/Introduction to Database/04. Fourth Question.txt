04. Explain 5 Challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS ?
Ans :- Challenges of file-based Storage System :
1. Data Redundancy : Data Redundancy occurs when the same data is stored in multiple 
files or locations, resulting in inconsistencies and errors.

2. Data Inconsistency : Data Inconsistency is another majaor challenge in a file-based
storage system.

3. Limited Scalability : File-based storage systems are often not very scalable. As the
amount of data in the system grows, it can become increasingly difficult to manage and 
maintain the system.

4. Security : File-based storage systems are often less secure than database systems. 
In a file-based storage system, it can be difficult to control who has access to data 
and what they can do with it.

5. Data Isolation : Data Isolation refers to the fact that in a file-based storage 
system, data is often stored in separate files, which makes it difficult to makes it 
difficult to access and share data across different applications or systems.
