05. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.
Ans :- In database management systems (DBMS), classification can refer to various 
concepts. Here are the main types of classification in DBMS along with explanations:
1. Data Classification:
- Hierarchical Classification: Data is organized in a tree-like structure where each 
record has one parent record and zero or more children records. This is useful for 
representing parent-child relationships like organizational charts.

- Network Classification: Similar to hierarchical classification, but a child record 
can have multiple parent records. This allows for more complex relationships but can 
be harder to manage than hierarchical classification.

- Relational Classification: Data is organized in tables with rows and columns. Each 
table represents an entity, and relationships between entities are established using 
keys. This is the most common classification used in modern relational databases like 
MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.


2. Index Classification:
- Clustered Index: The physical order of data in the table corresponds to the order of 
the index key values. This can improve the performance of queries that involve range 
searches or sorting.

- Non-clustered Index: The physical order of data in the table does not correspond to 
the order of the index key values. Instead, it contains pointers to the actual data 
rows, which can result in faster retrieval of specific rows but slower for range 
searches or sorting.


3. Access Classification:
- Sequential Access: Data is accessed in a sequential manner, from start to end. 
This is common in tape storage systems and can be inefficient for random access.

- Random Access: Data can be accessed directly, without having to read through other 
data first. This is common in disk-based storage systems and allows for faster access 
to specific records.


4. Query Classification:
- Ad-hoc Query: A one-time query that is not predefined and is typically used for 
exploratory analysis or troubleshooting.

- Stored Procedure: A pre-written query or set of queries stored in the database that 
can be executed repeatedly with different parameters. Stored procedures can improve 
performance and security by reducing the amount of data sent over the network and 
preventing SQL injection attacks.


5. Transaction Classification:
- Read-only Transaction: A transaction that only reads data from the database without 
making any changes. These transactions are typically used for reporting or analytics.

- Read-write Transaction: A transaction that reads data from the database and may also 
write data to the database. These transactions are used for most database operations, 
such as inserting, updating, or deleting records.

Each type of classification serves different purposes and has its own advantages and 
disadvantages depending on the specific requirements of the application and the 
characteristics of the data being managed.
