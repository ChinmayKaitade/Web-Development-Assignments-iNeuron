5. Write a short note on tab index.
ans: The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them
from being sequentially focusable (usually with the tab key, hence the name) and determine their relative 
ordering for sequential focus navigation.
It specifies the tab order of an element. (when the "tab" button is used for navigating). The tabindex attribute can
be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element). It only accepts integers as value from 
0 to 32767.

There are two additional options available for tabindex:

1) tabindex="0" -  this option allows elements that are not usually able to be focused via the keyboard to become 
focusable. This value of tabindex is particularly beneficial.

2) tabindex="-1" - this option enables elements that are not typically focusable to receive focus programmatically, 
such as through JavaScript, or as the target of links.
